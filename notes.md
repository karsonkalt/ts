# TypeScript

## Interfaces

- Interface describes the structure of an object
- You can implement an interface in a class
- Type is a custom type
- Interface has no implementation details at all, abstract classes do
- We can use an interface as a type
- We can enforce a certain structure on classes with interfaces
- Interfaces can also be used to describe functions, but is probably more appropriate to use a type
- We can not transalte interfaces to JS
- This is a pure development feature, they are not translated to runtime
